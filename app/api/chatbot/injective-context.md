  - Cosmos Hub
  - Solana
  - Polygon
  - Avalanche
  - And many other chains
- **Peggy Bridge**: Secure Ethereum bridge for ERC-20 tokens

### 4. **Staking & Governance**
- **Proof of Stake (PoS)**: Secure the network by staking INJ tokens
- **Staking Rewards**: Current APY ranges between 15-20%
- **On-Chain Governance**: INJ holders vote on protocol upgrades and parameters
- **Validator Network**: Decentralized network of validators securing the chain
- **Delegation**: Delegate INJ to validators and earn rewards

### 5. **Developer-Friendly**
